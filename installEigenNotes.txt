### Installing spline stuff for AlphaPilot:
1) Install mercurial and cmake-gui
sudo apt-get install mercurial

2) clone the special eigen repo:
hg clone https://bitbucket.org/tbs1980/eigen-numerical-integration-module

3) Build (install)
mkdir build
cd build
cmake-gui ..

Set the install dir to be "/usr" instead of "/usr/local".  This will make 
sure it gets used instead of the generic Eigen.

Click Configure and Generate until everything gets configured and generated.  Close cmake-gui.

sudo make install

4) Now you can use it.  You should be able to build catkin_ws now (using "catkin_make")
